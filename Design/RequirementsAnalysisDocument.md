## 1 Introduction

The proposed system aims to revolutionize the way students coordinate transportation to and from school. Presently, students rely on platforms like Telegram to organize ridesharing, resulting in open groups where individuals outside the school community can participate. This method lacks the necessary privacy and security standards vital for a school-centric transportation arrangement.

To address these concerns, the intention is to develop a specialized web application that will serve as a dedicated platform for school-affiliated students. This application will streamline the process of organizing ridesharing by providing a controlled environment where students can create and access ride advertisements, facilitating secure and accountable transportation arrangements.

The system will feature a user-friendly interface allowing students to create ride advertisements detailing trip start times, pricing, and available seats. Additionally, drivers will have personalized profiles showcasing their reviews, fostering a trusted community within the platform. Crucially, access to these functionalities will be restricted to individuals with school-affiliated email addresses, ensuring exclusivity and safeguarding against unauthorized access.

## 2 Current System

- **Platform**: Telegram groups are created where students share their plans for commuting to school, specifying details like departure time and cost-sharing.
- **Open Access**: These Telegram groups lack privacy and exclusivity, allowing anyone to join or participate, including individuals who are not part of the school community.
- **Limited Organization**: Coordination of ridesharing is manual and informal, relying on individual messages within a group without structured advertisement or application processes.
- **Security Concerns**: There's a lack of security measures to verify the identity of participants, potentially compromising the safety and trustworthiness of the transportation arrangements.

The shortcomings of the current system, such as its open accessibility and absence of structured coordination, highlight the need for a dedicated and secure platform tailored specifically for school-affiliated students to organize ridesharing in a controlled and efficient manner.

## 3 Proposed System

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

- Users can register via email. Users can't join without a school email.
- Users can edit profile, change photo, add name, etc.
- Users can comment on other users. These comments show in the userâ€™s profile.
- Users can log in to the application and see ride advertisements of other users. They see ride start time, price, available seats, driver. They can send applications.
- Users can create ride ads; in these ride ads, they must write price, start time, add max seats, and available seats. Ride ads disappear when the ride time comes. Users can accept or deny applications.
- Users can report users.

### 3.2 Nonfunctional Requirements

- **Quick Response**: The system should load content within 2 seconds on average.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy navigation for users of all technical abilities.
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with accessibility standards for users with disabilities.
- **Responsive Design**: Functionality across various devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
- **Responsive Support**: Timely assistance for user queries and issues.
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Inform users in advance about maintenance and updates.
- **High Uptime**: Aim for 99.9% uptime, minimizing maintenance-related downtime.
- **Regular Backups**: Protect against data loss with routine backups.
